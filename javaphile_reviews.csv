1,"We ordered hot chocolates and they were very bad in taste. We had to literally throw of them away.

They were very very thick and had to ask the waiter to add more milk. That still didn't solve the issue.

We ordered

2. Cinnamon Hot Chocolate
3. Salt Hot Chocolate",3 months ago,DELIVERY

1,"This place serves good coffee. I haven't tried breakfast here yet.

We tried 5 different kinds of coffee.

Icd Vietnamese
Creme cold brew
Salted caramel cold coffee
Java chip iced mocha
S&B cold coffee

All of them were good.
I would have liked a little more condensed milk in my Iced Vietnamese.

Overall good!","Jan 15, 2023",DELIVERY

S&B Cold Coffee (Shaken not Blended) was made in front of our eyes with the secret ingredient being condensed milk. It tasted as good as it looks!!

4,"Visited this place after work on a weekday evening. It's a small and cute cafe in Bandra where you can crash after a busy day at work, or even work from here as it's a work friendly cafe.

Tried their Raf Coffee and it was pretty decent I'd say. The taste of it was nicely bitter, just the way I like it but was alright.

Would really like to try more of coffees from here!","Jul 18, 2022",DELIVERY
1,"The coffee was strictly average. The food was all sitting behind a glass case looking dry and unappealing. To make matters worse, there was a photo shoot on in the cafe for which some of the food was removed, manhandled and put back on the shelf for sale. At these prices, the very least one can expect are reasonable levels of hygiene.","Jul 09, 2022",DELIVERY
5,"Ordered after a first amazing experience by ordering their amazing hot chocolate! On repeat the hot chocolate wasn‚Äôt how it used to be. It was too thin with too much milk, the taste was too bitter and wasn‚Äôt drinkable.","Jun 26, 2022",DINING

4,Having been to Italy and tasted the best coffee in the world I had never imagined coffee could taste and feel like Italy all over again in Mumbai. Javaphile makes the best coffee in the city.

1,"It was a last minute order just as they were about close, but the food was phenomenal. Good portion sizes, great variety, excellent taste. Even the packaging was great!
The Paris Brest and the Basque cheesecake are a must try! The hazelnut cookie had a great texture and was perfectly crumbly. The flourless chocolate cake had the perfect hint of lemon and tasted great when warmed a bit. The Paris Brest had just the right amount of coffee flavoured cream and great choux pastry.","Jan 02, 2022",DELIVERY

5,"New on the block in Bandra comes javaphile,
While I‚Äôm not much of a javaphile myself (so don‚Äôt peep my review if you wanted to know what the coffee is like) I do love sandwiches and breakfast

So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried thus far :

Akuri toast - this wasn‚Äôt my order but it was so so and my bf said he wouldn‚Äôt order it again

Truffle & parm

Turkey & ranch sandwich : good quality produce, I wasn‚Äôt too fond of the cheese maybe would‚Äôve preferred it melted, but the bread is lovely! Soft and spongy with a little bite to boot.

Caprese : honestly I heard Elftheria and didn‚Äôt think twice, their fresh mozzarella is the best. Paired with good pesto, tomatoes & bread you...read more","Nov 21, 2021",DINING

5,"I bought a harissa chicken sandwich. Taste was horrible, the bread was dry and not at all well heated as well. There was no salt either.
The coffee on the other hand was decent but could be better compared the price point and what other roasters have to offer in Mumbai.

5,"Visited Javaphile while passing by in the bandra lanes. Loved the vibe of this place the moment we saw it. They don‚Äôt have too many options on the menu if you‚Äôre looking for some Frappe or iced drink. However the server was prompt enough to make a caramel cold coffee of sorts for us.

However what disappointed me was the service. When asked for water they first were reluctant to serve all of us 4 glasses of water, instead they asked us if we wanted to buy a bottle of water

Secondly we were expected to place the order at the billing counter and again get up and get our food once they called out our name every time any of out orders were ready. This would not have been an issue for me...read more","Apr 10, 2021",DELIVERY
5,"This is a sophisticated place with modern minimalist coffee experience. They have sandwiches , desserts and hot chocolate besides coffee. They also have Turkish coffee which is so instagramable. There‚Äôs sand below the coffee to heat it which is the traditional way of Turkish coffees. The owner is super chill. He greets all the customers well. There‚Äôs an indoor and outdoor section. A happy vibe in these corona times. We would skip Starbucks and other cafes & head to this place.","Apr 10, 2021",DINING
