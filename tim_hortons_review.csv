3,"My friend loved the Hot chocolate, personality I'm not much of a sweet tooth and I found it far too sweet for me.

The cold coffee hit the spot
A great all round refresher for an evening wake me up drunk at work

The Americano, basically brewed as a long black left a bit to be desired, i feel the coffee beans used needed to be a bit different, these were nutty but not much else going on.... tasted better when it cooled down as flavours opened up as opposed to hot, weird.",one month ago,DELIVERY

5,"I recently tried Tim Hortons' Christmas special menu, and it was a delightful experience. The pesto bread had a perfect balance of flavors, with the aromatic pesto complementing the soft texture of the bread.
The popcorn latte was a unique and surprisingly tasty choice. The combination of popcorn and coffee might sound unusual, but the sweet and salty notes blended well, creating a memorable drink that I would recommend trying.
The stollen bread was a festive treat that added a touch of holiday spirit. The rich, fruity filling and powdered sugar coating made it a comforting and indulgent option during the holiday season.
Overall, Tim Hortons' Christmas special menu impressed me with its...read more",one month ago,DINING

5,"The staff are very casual‚Ä¶ they gave the wrong order inspite us repeating atleast 3ice. And the lady who took the order n then lied to cover it up.

We requested for the rice bowl order to be packed‚Ä¶ they put whatever fit in the box n threw out the rest. So not the order we paid for.

Wen we confronted her n front of her manager‚Ä¶ she flatly denied n lied.

They definitely need to train their staff on Customer Service",2 months ago,DINING
