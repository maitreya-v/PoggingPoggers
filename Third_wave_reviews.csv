5,"This review has nothing against Third wave coffee the chain. However, it‚Äôs specifically about this Mahim outlet. The staff is extremely unprofessional and upon calling out a mistake, they were ready to blame each other. I‚Äôm a strict vegetarian and had ordered for a vegetarian sandwich. However, They served me a chicken sandwich which I even ate. Upon finding something fishy I enquired if it was the right sandwich served and the waitress sheepishly agreed it wasn‚Äôt and was quick to blame the preparer. When I said I wanted to speak to the manager, they pointed out to the cashier lying that he was the manager and were not even sorry about their mistake.

5,I recently visited this place & was surprised that it was not half as bad as the reviews. I tried their iced caramel machiato & loved it ! Wasn't bitter .... wasn't iced down just an amazing coffee. The ambiance gets a little noisy but great place to catch up with friends or read a book. If you like coffee go for it !,20 days ago,DELIVERY

1,"Firstly, there‚Äôs nothing welcoming about this place. The moment you enter, the waiters aren't even keen, rather, they seem disinterested in what we want, including placing our order. The vibe is just okay; nothing great. When it comes to the food, the menu wasn't updated, and there was no pizza available. We ordered a sandwich, which was completely bland, lacking any flavors. The nachos were nothing more than wafer chips topped with onions, rajma, and some sauce. After reminding the server, he managed to add jalapenos and olives to it, but it still lacked taste. When the clock struck 11, we were reminded by three waiters within a span of five minutes that the restaurant was closing. It...read more",4 months ago,DELIVERY
