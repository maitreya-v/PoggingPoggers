5,"service - was excellent they customized to our liking but coffee we had was ok.
ambience- sitting is not too pleasant. seems like the hotel reception staff is sitting with you. they should change arrangements. Other outside guests coming for rooms/hotel inquiry are also next to you.
coffee- maybe our choice was not right - South Indian filter coffee frappe was highly recommended by staff. it was sweet, thick, creamy but artificial creaminess type with thickner Or emulsifier. made with ready frappe mix, didn't enjoy the texture n it was too heavy.",one month ago,DELIVERY
1,"A quaint place in the premises of Juhu Residency, this place surprised me. Asif Shaikh gave us impeccable service. He took care the coffee was as we like to have it.

1,"Stumbled onto Ettarra by chance, but keep going back by choice. It's an experience to enjoy. The indoor as well as outdoor seating is great, and the food and beverage options are fantastic. My favourites so far are the South Indian Filter Kaapi Frappe, the Naariyal Frappe, and the berliners. They will customise the drinks to your liking (make it stronger, thicker, sweeter, etc) and have milk alternatives for all, which is a blessing.

The staff is very good, service is prompt and cheerful and they explain things to you if you're unsure. If you're lucky, you'll meet Sabina and it's impossible not to smile back at her, with her infectious energy.

All in all, a great place to spend some...read more",3 months ago,DELIVERY
