5,"such a cute place, totally in love with the vegan, keto options! Courteous lovely staff. Absolutely nothing was sub par, it was certainly the most delicious meal I‚Äôve had in restaurants in a very long time. I‚Äôm sure the care and craftsmanship is top class. I‚Äôm returning as soon as I can to this new fav of mine.
Dishes - Quinoa and brown rice Risotto, Peanut and Pesto keto salad, keto Khau suey noodles and finally carrot walnut cake ü©∑",13 days ago,DINING

The Cubano sandwich had too much pepper and the overall flavour wasn‚Äôt balanced.

The Rainbow sandwich was quite nice and flavourful.",27 days ago,DELIVERY

5,"My first visit at Earth cafe Juhu was a mix of positive and negatives.

Ambience was good. Music was not loud. Fairly clean but Tables are very close to each other. Staff was attentive. Cappuccino was good.

Avocado bruschetta was okay. Avocado was fresh but the bread was dry and felt stale. While the sourdough exterior was toasty and hard, the center did not feel fresh or fluffy. Portion size was disappointing for the price.


Staff is biased in their treatment towards customers. While they allow some to linger for hours, they ensure that other customers leave ASAP",3 months ago,DELIVERY

Also, special mention to the owner and staff of the restaurant for helping me out when I could not find my lost valuable. The owner of the restaurant went an extra mile to ensure that I had complete access to all details. Highly satisfied with their customer centricity :)",3 months ago,DELIVERY

5,I have been to the restaurant 2 days ago. The quantity served there is way more than what u are sending for home delivery. The filling was very less and the wrap seemed smaller or leaner I would say. Taste was just the same. But if I am paying the same amount then why this partiality,6 months ago,DINING

Avocado Bruchetta, was perfect. Pil Dil which is basically mushroom and veggies grilled, is yummy and sumptuous. The added drizzle of garlic oil adds to the flavour. The coffee and juice were wonderful too. Early mornings can be wonderful here. The service is quick and ambience is just amazing.",6 months ago,DINING

Everything we tried was delicious highly recommend their smoothie bowls, sandwiches and the orange chocolate cake. The food plating is so pleasing to the eye and tastes even better. Must try for the best vegan experience",6 months ago,DINING

5,"Appalling experience, A cafe called Earth who treated customers like aliens. We arrived at the cafe and just ordered juice and an americano. 40 minutes out, no service. asked the server why the delay. he reacted with arrogance 'it takes time the kitchen is busy'. for a glass of juice , the kitchen is busy!? on top of that when I was leaving disappointed , they charged me for the juice. did you not hear your customer complaining about it for 40 mins! Guys, Do yourself a favour and stay away from this place. They charge exorbitant prices for little to nothing on the plate and have the audacity to provide pathetic service.",7 months ago,DINING

The staff were all friendly and attentive, and the owner even took the time to come over and personally greet people and thank them for coming in.

The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a sweet potato starter and it was fresh, flavorful and made with high-quality ingredients. They also had a great selection of smoothies which was also fresh and baked goods, all of which looked amazing.

But what really stood out to me was the exceptional service. Despite the busy lunch rush, the staff remained cheerful, attentive and...read more",7 months ago,DINING

5,"Quite average and expensive food to be honest. Pizza at 900-1000 bucks is the most average pizza I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life. The pizza base was horrible. The mushroom starters was more oily than any fried food I‚Äôve ever had.Not worth spending 1k per person for dinner at all. Rather go to bombay salad, seeds of life or greenr. This place won‚Äôt last in juhu for long",8 months ago,DINING
